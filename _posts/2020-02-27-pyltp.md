## pip install pyltp

There is a installing error of pip install pyltp on macOS 10.15.3 with python 3.7.
The error seems like that:
```
    #define PyType_HasFeature(t,f) (((t)->tp_flags & (f)) != 0)
    ^
    1 error generated.
    error: command 'clang++' failed with exit status 1
```

The official support python version of pyltp is python 3.6, which does not support 3.7.

The solution is installing pyltp manually:
```
$ cd ~/Downloads/
$ git clone https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/pyltp
$ cd pyltp
$ git clone https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp.git
$ open -t ~/Downloads/pyltp/patch/libs/python/src/converter/builtin_converters.cpp
```

Then, change the code on the line of 51 from:
```
return PyUnicode_Check(obj) ? _PyUnicode_AsString(obj) : 0;
```
to
```
return (void *)(PyUnicode_Check(obj) ? _PyUnicode_AsString(obj) : 0);
```

And back to the main dictionary and install pyltp: 
```
$ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
$ python setup.py install
```

After several minutes, pyltp would be installed successfully.
