Thanks for the ZeroTier to create route between zerotier and private network.
This is a modified page of <https://zerotier.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/224395274/Route+between+ZeroTier+and+Physical+Networks> which has a small error in their iptable rules.


This seems to be the simplest pattern for getting remote access to your LAN. It doesn't require access to the LAN's router or have some of the pitfalls of bridging. This requires a Linux PC or VM, something that runs iptables, on your LAN. A raspberrypi works. This is a [NAT/Masquerade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation") setup.

Possible Disadvantages:

-   No broadcast/multicast across networks (but the mobile OS's don't allow this anyways).

-   Can't initiate connections *from* the LAN *to* an external ZeroTier client.

### Summary

-   Install ZeroTier

-   Add a managed route to the ZeroTier network (at [my.zerotier.com](http://my.zerotier.com/ "http://my.zerotier.com"))

-   Enable IP Forwarding

-   Configure iptables


### Install ZeroTier

<https://www.zerotier.com/download/>

```
sudo zerotier-cli join $NETWORK_ID 
sudo zerotier-cli listnetworks
```

Authorize it at [my.zerotier.com/network/$NETWORK_ID](http://my.zerotier.com/network/$NETWORK_ID "http://my.zerotier.com/network/$NETWORK_ID")



### Configure the ZeroTier managed route

At [my.zerotier.com/network/$NETWORK_ID](http://my.zerotier.com/network/$NETWORK_ID "http://my.zerotier.com/network/$NETWORK_ID") -> Settings -> Managed Routes

This adds another route to every device joined to the ZeroTier network.

|Destination |(Via) |
|:---:|:---:|
|$PHY_SUB |$ZT_ADDR |

For example:

|Destination |(Via) |
|:---:|:---:|
|192.168.0.0/23 |192.168.192.36 |


Configure the destination route as slightly **larger** than the actual physical subnet, here /23 instead of /24 (a smaller number is a bigger subnet in this notation) This makes devices that are on both the physical and the ZeroTier network prefer the physical connection.

### Enable IP forwarding

This can vary depending on linux distribution. Typically:

Edit **/etc/sysctl.conf** to uncomment **net.ipv4.ip_forward**. This enables forwarding at boot.
And then, configuring the iptables, and save the rules for the next boot.

First, change to the root account of the system.
```
su root
```
and input the password.

Then, create a shell file to execute the magnifications.
```
touch iptables.sh
```
Paste the following content to the `iptables.sh` file.
```
iptables -F
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
PHY_IFACE=enp5s0; ZT_IFACE=ztbpanwl6z
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $PHY_IFACE -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i $PHY_IFACE -o $ZT_IFACE -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i $ZT_IFACE -o $PHY_IFACE -j ACCEPT
apt install iptables-persistent
bash -c iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```
where **ZT_IFACE** and **PHY_IFACE** can be found by `ifconfig`, in this case, they are `enp5s0` and `ztbpanwl6z` respectively. 

After that, process the `iptables.sh`
```
bash iptables.sh
```

### Test!

-   Turn off wifi on your phone

-   Join it to the zerotier network, authorize it

-   Try to access something on the physical LAN

-   If not work, you may need to restart your system or network.
