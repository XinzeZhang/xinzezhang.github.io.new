## Solution of BlueScreen Error of bthport.sys

Due to my experience, installing win10 on MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019) via Bootcamp will emit a blue-screen error (causing by bthport.sys) in the process of installing mac drivers by Launch Conversion Assistant in Win10 system.

The reason I guess is the problem of bluetooth drivers.

The solution I use is deleting the folder of

```
./BootCamp/Drivers/Broadcom/BroadcomBluetooth
```

which avoids the blue-screen error and successfully install Win10 1909.
